4.
-> no free dir feature, only in 3x3 matrix -> look after 6left positions
(first two columns) -> value of left, look after 6 right positions (second
and third column for right), after first two rows for up, second two rows for down


5:
 -> 3x3x3 features:
    1.) field (10wall, 150way, 100selfcoord,
    nearest coin: >=150 -> the smaller the distance, the bigger value
    between 150 and 255. The same with crates.
    2.) bomb -> 255where not a bomb danger, 3,2,1, where bomb danger
    3.) free direction: look after nearest moves (up, down, left, right) and
    after their neighbors (again up down left right) sum up for every possible move
    the available ways and present in a feature x100. The rest is 10.
 -> steps, alle 5k episodes, 20steps more allowed (start at 20steps, after
 5k episodes -> 40 steps, after 10k episodes 60steps...at 100k episodes 400steps

6.
 same as 5, difference: all 10k episodes, 10more steps (start at 20 steps,
 after 10k -> 30steps, after 20k 40steps...400k episodes training in a sum

7.
 difference in the bomb feature: the position of the bomb encoded in the
 free direction feature. If bomb there, you cannot go this direction.
 difference in a field feature: if bomb there, the value set to 3,2,1 (the way
 is 10, so even worse -> zero)


 8. 3.steps for free dir


 9. from -15 to -25 for invalid actions reward

 10. fixed model, 3steps free dir

 66 -> trained model from 6, training continued mit 10.

 99 -> trained model from 9, training continued mit 10.

 999 -> trained model from 99, training continued with 10 + oponents there in the field_ch -> minus value for nearest oponent, distance included.

 99cont -> trained model from 99, training continued 99

 99coins -> trained model from 99, training continued 99 with a goal to collect coins

 10cont -> continue 10 at ~45k

 10 cont with two peacefull agents and one random -> 10cont used against agents, training continued

 10 cont with two peacefull agents and one random with bombs and crates optimized:
    - bombs -> distance to the center of the bomb included in the bomb_ch feature (multiplied with 3,2,1)
    - field_ch feature -> modify nearest crate if crate placed on the side (diagonal in the 3x3 + in the next 4 steps is a way (0) and
    fifth position is a crate) -> this is a trap and there should not be placed a bomb
