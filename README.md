FML: ReinforcementLearning - Bomberman Agent

We implemented two versions of the Bomb_Me_If_You_Can agent. The first one is based on a CNN and will be participating in the tournament.
The second one is based on the Fully Connected Neural Network and can be found in the directory FCNN_model.

In order to run the best FCNN version of the agent, the directory "bomb_me_if_you_can" inside the FCNN_model should be placed in the agent/code directory 
with the name "bomb_me_if_you_can".
